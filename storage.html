        <h1>Storage</h1>
        <p>
          Storage is designed for you to be able to store all the data from documents to applications. These come in a big range of sizes from 128GB up to 20TB. You can get many different types of hardware storage for your pc that are;
          <ul>
            <li>M.2</li>
            <li>SSD (Solid state drive)</li>
            <li>HDD (Hard disk drive)</li>
          </ul>
          You can also get external hard drive but you can get portable storage that are;
          <ul>
            <li>Flash drive - USB stick</li>
            <li>Floppy disk</li>
            <li>Memory stick</li>
            <li>Memory card</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>How to install</h3>
        <p>If you have  chosen M.2 storage this will be installed differently as this is installed directly to the motherboard PCIe express slots. 
        <br>
        If you are installing a SSD or HDD you will need to find the mounting brackets inside the case and place them into the brackets and screw it into the case normally located at the back of the case where the power supply sits or in much bigger cases in the front where the motherboard sits. Then you need to get a SATA cable and plug the drives to the cable and then connect it to the motherboard in its specific location.
