      <h3>Part picker:</h3>
      <p>
        Now that you have learnt about each part of the computer, you are now
        ready to start picking the components within the pc. Using this website;
        <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part picker</a> will enable you to check that all parts
        are compatible with each other as you have learnt that not all parts
        will work together.
        <br />
        IMPORTANT: When you are picking parts make sure that you do not spend
        over your budget.
