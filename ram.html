        <h1>RAM</h1>

    <section>
        <p>Ram also known as Random-access Memory is used to perform every task that you wish to do such as; using the internet, playing games or editing documents and many, many more. Memory also lets you swap between different tasks while keeping you in the same spot.
        Depending on the age of your pc that you may have (if you have one at all) you will come across many types of ram. These will consist of the use of DDR which is called "Double Data Rate." You will most commonly find DDR3, DDR4 and the newest DDR5. When looking at each type of ram you will also come across that they will all specify different speeds in MHz. The higher the speed that it has the faster it has the faster it will be able to perform the tasks.
        Starting at DDR3 speeds will range from 800MHz to 2133MHz, DDR4 will range from 2133MHz to 4266MHz and DDR5 will range from 4000MHz to 6400MHz. The ram works hand in hand with the motherboard that you have as the motherboards will only work with 1 type of ram so be sure to check your motherboard first before deicding what ram to pick.
        </p>
        <h3>How to install</h3>
        <p>When you are installing the ram into the motherboard you will find the slots like in the picture to the right. The amount of ram slots will depend on the motherboard that you have, as some will only have two ram slots and most commonly they will have 4 slots. First you see that it has a tab at the top of it and you will need to press it down as this is the "lock" for the ram to stop it moving or falling out at a later date. You will then notice that the ram slot and the ram has a little notch in it, this is designed this way so that the ram can only be insterted one way or else you will damage the ram and motherboard. 
        Once you have pushed in the ram to the slot normally by the bottom first, you hear the tab at the top make a sound. This is the ram being locked into place and has be placed in correctly.
