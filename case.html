        Computer cases are where you will hold all components inside, these are
        normally enclosed with sections cut out to allow the fans to allow
        ventilation to extract the warm air and bring in cold air. They have
        removable panels being on the front, and each of the sides. Computer
        cases will come in multiple different sizes depending on your
        application, these are; Full tower, Mid tower and Mini tower. The major
        difference between the sizes was the amount accessable external drive
        bays for you to add CD drives but over in recent times most computer
        cases dont have any external bays as most towers are used as show peices
        that have full tempted glass panels that are used by enthusiasts to become show peices with the use of RGB lights and water pipes.

      <h3>How to install</h3>
      <p>
        There isn't to much to say here as you will be installing all the other
        parts to the pc case, there isn't any set order in which order you set
        them into the case but many people have there own prefered order to make
        it easier for them to build. We would suggest that you start by building
        up the motherboard and then placing it inside and start adding in the
        rest of the items. You will be given all the extra items like cables
        with in all the components that you have.
